# CSV-Sorting
My take on a CSV sorter in Python; uses tkinter to dynamically make a little listbox so you can pick which column to sort by.

Numerical values are sorted descending by default, but text entries will be backwards. This is how Python sorting handles, so the reverse button was included if needed. Just rerun the program the same but with the sort reversed, should meet what you need.
